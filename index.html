  Welcome! Supporting a dog with kidney disease is challenging, supporting a puppy with kidney disease is even more so. <b>I am not a veterinarian</b>. I created this website to share my own experiences and learnings as a first-time dog-owner supporting a puppy with kidney disease. Opinions expressed on this website are that of my own and should not be taken as medical advice. This website is not intended to be used to diagnose or treat any dog. Please consult your veterinarian for their professional opinion on how to best support your dog.

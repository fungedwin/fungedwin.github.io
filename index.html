Welcome! Supporting a puppy with kidney disease (in my case renal dysplasia) is extremely challenging. We had just gone from feeling super excited welcoming this new furry family member to now feeling anxious and devastated over the news of the illness.

While the prognosis is unclear and often poor, we can make adjustments to their diet, and provide supportive medications and supplements in the hopes of delaying disease progression and improving their quality of life. Learning about the disease and supportive care can be extremely overwhelming. There is a lot of information out there, though most of which refer to supporting an adult or senior dog with chronic kidney disease not a growing puppy. I created this website to share my own experiences and summarize information I have found as a first-time dog-owner supporting a puppy with kidney disease.

 Lastly, donâ€™t forget to treasure every moment with your puppy!

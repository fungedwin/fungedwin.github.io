title: "What is Renal Dysplasia?"

Renal dysplasia is a congenital condition where either one or both of the puppy’s kidneys were not formed properly in the womb. It’s a hereditary disease though the exact hereditary dynamics are not well understood and there are no DNA tests available. It is often diagnosed in puppies (< 1 years old). Dogs with renal dysplasia have significantly lower kidney function compared to a normal dog and is considered to have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). 

## What are some common symptoms?

Symptoms usually develop within a few months after birth, though can easily be overlooked. Common symptoms include:

- Increased Water Intake
- Increased Urination
- Low Appetite
- Nausea/Vomiting
- Lethargy
- Stunted growth

As a young puppy, Arlo had a low appetite and was occasionally vomiting. Over time, we also observed increased water intake and urination. 

## How is it diagnosed?

An abdominal ultrasound is usually conducted to evaluate the kidney structure and diagnose the condition. A surgical wedge biopsy can be done to more definitively confirm the diagnosis, though this is often not recommended to avoid additional damage to the kidneys. Bloodwork will usually show elevated kidney values (SDMA, BUN, Creatinine and/or Phosphorus), and Urinalysis may show low Urine Specific Gravity (urine is not concentrated).  In Arlo’s case, his urinalysis also showed significant protein and blood in the urine (proteinuria and hematuria). Following diagnosis, the bloodwork and urinalysis will determine the stage of chronic kidney disease (Stage 1-4). 

Note: “Normal” Bloodwork values are often based on confidence intervals of adult dogs. Puppies may be healthy but have bloodwork values that fall outside the “normal” range. Bloodwork or urinalysis alone does not necessarily indicate that your puppy has a kidney disease or renal dysplasia.

## How is it treated?

There are unfortunately no cures for renal dysplasia. Vets often follow a similar treatment plan to dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to slow down disease progression. However since CKD is usually diagnosed in elderly dogs, it is important to balance it against the growing needs of puppy. Treatment is generally focused on supportive care, and may involve dietary changes, supplements, fluid therapy, and supportive medication depending on symptoms (proteinuria, low appetite, nausea). I will share more details about my treatment plan for Arlo in future posts. 

Theoretically, a kidney transplant could “cure” a dog from renal dysplasia.  However, it is generally not recommended due to the low surgery success rate in dogs (~40%), prohibitive costs, and ethical concerns. 

## What is the prognosis?

Unfortunately the prognosis for dogs with renal dysplasia is usually pretty poor. When Arlo was diagnosed at 7 months old, we were told he may only have months left. Based on my personal research, I have seen a number of stories of puppies making to 1-2 years of age, and some rare cases of dogs continuing to live past year 3.

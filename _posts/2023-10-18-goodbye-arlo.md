Arlo passed away peacefully on Monday, October 16 2023, exactly 21 months since coming home, and 17 months and 2 days since his renal dysplasia diagnosis. We had just celebrated his 2nd birthday a few weeks prior. While our lives together in this world were far too short, we were together every day and never took a moment for granted.

When Arlo was diagnosed with Renal Dysplasia at 7.5 months old, several vets told us he likely only had months left. We weren't sure if we would be able to celebrate his first birthday. Then at 11 months old, he was diagnosed with a bunch of congenital heart issues as well. I knew our time together would be very limited and tried to do everything I could to give him the best care while spending as much quality time together as possible. Arlo surprised everyone with his resiliency and gave us 17 extra months to show him this world and create many wonderful happy memories together.

Arlo loved going to the forest. We always said the forest was his best medicine. I am grateful we were able to do one last forest walk together on his last day and say our goodbyes. I like to think that his spirit will live on in the forest and we will visit him often. I love you and miss you so much, Arlo.

Right now I am in deep grieving. At another time, I would like to go back and write up a few posts to finish sharing Arlo’s journey and my experience and learnings.

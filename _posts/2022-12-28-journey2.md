title: "Arlo's Journey - Part 2: First 3 months post-diagnosis"
---

It’s been a while since I’ve posted an update on Arlo. When I first created this website, I envisioned posting regular updates about Arlo and sharing my learnings to help others. The truth is, it’s difficult to write and share when things aren’t going well. In late August, a few weeks after I started this website, and about 3 months after his renal dysplasia diagnosis, Arlo was also diagnosed with severe congenital heart disease(more on this in part 3). 

Renal dysplasia is a serious condition, and while there are some “success” stories of dogs living to a few years old, there are also many that do not. Back in May, we were told Arlo may only have months left. I am so grateful that as of December 2022, Arlo is still with us and actually doing quite well. Supporting a puppy with renal dysplasia is a very emotional, personal, exhausting, but above all rewarding experience.  My heart goes out to every owner out there currently supporting their puppy with this disease, as well as all those who lost their baby to this disease.

# May-June 2022 (The first few weeks post-diagnosis)

The first 2 weeks post-diagnosis were probably the most difficult emotionally. I cried a lot. It was difficult to focus on work and my other obligations. I felt lost and shattered. I wasn’t sure if we would be able to celebrate his first birthday in September, or Christmas. Even 7 months later, as I write this post now, the emotional pain still feels raw. 

I joined a few Facebook groups with other dog owners that are supporting dogs with kidney disease ([there’s even one specifically for those with puppies who have renal dysplasia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1603002826574540/)). The groups were helpful in providing support for one another, as well as sharing tips that worked for some owners. I poured whatever free time I had into learning more about the disease.

A few weeks before Arlo’s diagnosis, I happened to be reading a book, [The Forever Dog](https://foreverdog.com/), which talked about how diet and exercise plays an important role in a dog’s health. I was a first time dog-owner who was just looking for ways to help my puppy live a happy and long life. The book advocates raw-feeding instead of kibble diet, and shared insights into the ingredients used in kibble diets. 

There’s a lot of conflicting recommendations on what to feed a puppy with renal dysplasia. Should we continue feeding puppy food until they’re adult?  Should we switch to a low-protein kidney diet? A high protein kidney diet since they’re still growing? Our vets at the time were recommending we switch Arlo to an adult renal diet immediately. However, since he was quite underweight and had a low appetite. they also recommended that we feed him whatever he’s willing to eat (more important to eat something than nothing). Our vets gave a number of options for prescription renal diets (Royal Canin, Hills Science, Purina), they also suggested potentially trying out [Just Food For Dogs Renal Diet](https://www.justfoodfordogs.com/product/renal-support-low-protein/FBS10040214.html). They also told us that we could do a custom diet for Arlo through Just Food For Dogs that may be more suitable for puppies. 

As much as I wanted Arlo to eat a kidney-support diet, I even more wanted him to enjoy life and be happy.  I wanted him to be so happy that he would want to stay in this world longer. That was my philosophy. He was a puppy, and if he only had months left, I wanted him to experience the world and give him the opportunity to eat the things he likes to eat (in moderation).  What kind of a life is it for a puppy if they can no longer eat chicken, beef, lamb, or have treats, or chew on bully sticks?

It was difficult choosing the right diet for Arlo given all the conflicting information.  He was also a very picky eater who would often refuse the same food that he loved after a week or so.  I wanted him to grow healthily while supporting his kidneys.  Ultimately, I picked Just Food For Dogs as it had ingredients I recognized (Lamb,  Rice, Carrots etc.), and I felt that a "home"cooked recipe was healthier and had a higher moisture content so he wouldn't be as dehydrated.  Just Food For Dogs also uses human-grade food. The Forever Dog book talked about biologically appropriate  ingredients for dogs, and I felt that the other Renal diets from Royal Canin, Hills and Purina were using ingredients that I didn't recognize or felt comfortable giving to a dog. Many of them had little to no meat. Having said that, I know that there are others who felt the Renal diets from traditional pet food companies have really helped their dogs. 

Getting Arlo to eat each day was a huge challenge.  Given how underweight he was, I continued to try to feed him 3-meals a day (instead of dropping down to 2), and was frankly free-feeding him. He seemed to like Stella and Chewy freeze-dried Meal Mixers, so I also gave him a few ounces of those mixed into the renal diet to try and encourage him to eat. We also mixed in Aluminum Hydroxide since Arlo had elevated phosphorus, and Omega-3 supplement for kidney support. I became obsessed with counting his calories at each meal to make sure he was eating enough by the end of the day. We gave Arlo Entyce, an appetite stimulant medication to help him eat. The medication worked well but I was hesitant on being reliant on it, and tried to give it to him only a few times a week.

Right after his renal dysplasia diagnosis, I also made an appointment for Arlo to see an integrative (holistic) vet, though she was booked out until late July. From reading the Forever Dog book and reading posts from other dog owners in similar situations, I felt that meeting with a holistic vet could help provide a different perspective and additional insights on things I could do to help Arlo.

# July & August (Holistic Vet & Custom Diet) 
It continued to be a challenge getting Arlo to eat, though he was slowly gaining weight. The Entyce appetite stimulant medication definitely helped, but without it, Arlo was only eating about 1/4 of what he’s supposed to eat. I continue to encourage him to eat the Just Food for Dogs Kidney Support diet, but started giving him more and more of regular commercial raw dog food since Arlo was refusing the kidney diet. He often would refuse the commercial raw dog food as well. I decided to reach out to Just Food For Dogs team to create a custom kidney support diet for Arlo (based on Arlo’s food preferences). More on this in a separate post later.

In late July, we finally saw our holistic vet, who’s now Arlo’s primary vet. I strongly recommend for those who could afford to see a holistic vet.  I don't reject traditional medicine, but I feel like holistic medicine compliments traditional medicine and allows owners to make the most informed decisions. Our vet spent a long time with me and Arlo. She made sure Arlo was as comfortable as possible. We went home with a few bottles of supplements, to help support Arlo's kidney and liver, and more importantly renewed hope.

We’re fortunate that we live within walking distance of Lake Michigan. I took the opportunity to enjoy summer weather and go on multiple walks a day with Arlo by the lake. Arlo loved to chase squirrels and going on long walks by the lake. I made sure he got as much of that as he wanted each day.

In August, we took Arlo to a cabin in Wisconsin for a few days. I wanted Arlo to experience the forest and always dreamed of camping and going to a cabin with my dog.  It was an important item to check off from my bucket list with Arlo. Though no one really knows how long a puppy with renal dysplasia may live, most vets will say that the puppy likely has very limited time left. With that,  apart from taking care of the puppy, I think it’s helpful to think about what experience you want to enjoy with your puppy and make sure to do them too.

We did Arlo’s bloodwork every month. His kidney values were slowly creeping up but relatively stable. By the end of August, his Creatinine was 2.5, and still had elevated phosphorus as well as proteinuria. However, towards the end of August, our vets detected a heart murmur which was later diagnosed as congenital heart issues (more on this in part 3)
